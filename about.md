## Project Involvement
- Participated in the [NIST LWC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography) [side-channel evaluation project](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/index.php?id=LWC), initiated by George Mason University (GMU). I contributed to the design of side-channel protected [hardware](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/LWC/LWC_Finalists_protected_HW_implementations.html) and [software](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/LWC/LWC_Finalists_protected_SW_implementations.html) implementations of Xoodyak. Additionally, I evaluated multiple [side-channel protected hardware implementations](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/LWC/Lab_Implementation_Matching_HW.html). The designs and evaluations contributed to the [NIST LWC Final Report](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8454/final) and the [GMU Evaluation Report](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/LWC/SCA_Evaluation_and_Benchmarking_of_LWC_Finalists_LWC_Workshop_2023.pdf).
